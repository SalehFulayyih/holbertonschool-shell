Here's a concise summary of what happens when you type ls *.c and press Enter in your shell:

Command: The ls command lists files and directories.

Pattern: The *.c wildcard matches files ending with .c.

Expansion: The shell expands *.c to the actual filenames (e.g., file2.c file3.c).

Execution: The ls command is executed with the expanded filenames.

Output: The matched filenames are displayed in the terminal.

In essence, typing ls *.c lists all the files with a .c extension in the current directory. This helps you quickly see all your C source files.

Here's a visual example to help you understand:
